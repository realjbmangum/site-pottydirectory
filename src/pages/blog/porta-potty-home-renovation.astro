        So you're finally tackling that bathroom renovation you've been putting off. Exciting! But here's a question that might not have crossed your mind yet: <strong>what happens when your only bathroom is torn apart for two weeks?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where renting a porta potty saves the day. It might feel a little strange to have one in your driveway, but trust me - it beats the alternatives. Let's talk about why it makes sense, what it costs, and how to make it work smoothly.
      </p>

      <AdSlot slot="content" />

      <h2 id="why-rent">Why Rent a Porta Potty for a Home Renovation?</h2>

      <p>
        When your bathroom is out of commission, you have a few options:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a neighbor's bathroom</strong> - Awkward, and gets old fast</li>
        <li><strong>Go to a nearby store or gym</strong> - Fine during the day, terrible at 3 AM</li>
        <li><strong>Stay in a hotel</strong> - Expensive and disruptive</li>
        <li><strong>Rent a porta potty</strong> - Available 24/7, right outside your door</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For renovations lasting more than a few days, a porta potty is usually the most practical choice. It's there whenever you need it, and you don't have to impose on anyone else.
      </p>

      <h2 id="cost">What Does It Cost?</h2>

      <p>
        Here's the good news: renting a porta potty for home use is surprisingly affordable.
      </p>

      <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Typical Home Renovation Rental Costs</h4>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Standard unit:</strong> $150 - $250 per month</li>
          <li><strong>Deluxe unit (with sink):</strong> $200 - $350 per month</li>
          <li><strong>Weekly rental:</strong> $100 - $175 per week</li>
          <li><strong>Delivery + pickup:</strong> Usually included, or $50-100 extra</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        Compare that to a hotel room at $100+ per night, and renting a porta potty starts looking like a bargain. Plus, you get to stay in your own home and keep an eye on your renovation.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-type">What Type Should You Get?</h2>

      <p>
        For a home renovation, you have a couple of good options:
      </p>

      <h3>Standard Unit</h3>
      <p>
        Your basic porta potty with hand sanitizer. It gets the job done, and it's the most affordable option. Perfectly fine for a short renovation where you still have running water inside for hand washing.
      </p>

      <h3>Deluxe Unit with Hand Wash Sink</h3>
      <p>
        If your renovation affects your kitchen sink too, or you just want the convenience, go for a unit with a built-in hand wash station. It has a foot pump or hands-free faucet with fresh water and soap. Worth the extra $50-75 per month for most people.
      </p>

      <h3>Flushable Unit</h3>
      <p>
        Some companies offer units with flushing capability and a more "indoor bathroom" feel. They cost more and require water hookup, but if you're doing a long renovation (6+ weeks), the comfort upgrade might be worth it.
      </p>

      <h2 id="where-to-put">Where to Put It</h2>

      <p>
        Placement matters for convenience and your neighbors' sanity:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Driveway</strong> - The most common spot. Easy to access, level surface, and simple for the service truck to reach.</li>
        <li><strong>Side yard</strong> - Good if you want it less visible from the street. Just make sure there's a clear path from your house.</li>
        <li><strong>Backyard</strong> - Works if you have access, but service trucks need to reach it too.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A few things to keep in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep it within a reasonable walk from your back door (you'll be using it at night)</li>
        <li>Make sure it's on level ground</li>
        <li>Check if your HOA has rules about temporary structures</li>
        <li>Be considerate of neighbors - don't place it right against their fence</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-long">How Long Will You Need It?</h2>

      <p>
        This depends on your project, but here are some typical timelines:
      </p>

      <div class="overflow-x-auto my-8">
        <table class="min-w-full border border-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
          <thead class="bg-gray-50">
            <tr>
              <th class="px-6 py-3 text-left text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900">Project Type</th>
              <th class="px-6 py-3 text-left text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900">Typical Duration</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody class="divide-y divide-gray-200">
            <tr>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-900">Bathroom refresh (fixtures, paint)</td>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-600">3-5 days</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-900">Full bathroom remodel</td>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-600">2-4 weeks</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-900">Bathroom addition</td>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-600">4-8 weeks</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-900">Whole house renovation</td>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-600">2-6 months</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        Add a buffer - renovations almost always take longer than planned. Most rental companies are flexible about extending if needed.
      </p>

      <h2 id="service">What About Servicing?</h2>

      <p>
        Your rental includes regular servicing - typically once a week for residential use. The service tech will:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pump out the waste tank</li>
        <li>Clean and sanitize the interior</li>
        <li>Restock toilet paper and hand sanitizer</li>
        <li>Check for any issues</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For a typical family, weekly service is plenty. If you have a large household or guests staying over, you might want to ask about twice-weekly service.
      </p>

      <h2 id="tips">Tips for a Smooth Experience</h2>

      <p>A few things that'll make life easier:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Add lighting</strong> - A motion-sensor light near the unit is a game-changer for nighttime trips</li>
        <li><strong>Create a path</strong> - If it's on grass, lay down some stepping stones or a mat</li>
        <li><strong>Stock extras</strong> - Keep extra toilet paper inside (in a waterproof container)</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate with your contractor</strong> - Make sure workers know it's available for them too</li>
        <li><strong>Give neighbors a heads up</strong> - A quick "hey, we're renovating and need this temporarily" goes a long way</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives to Consider</h2>

      <p>
        If a porta potty really doesn't work for your situation, here are some other options:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Portable camping toilet</strong> - Cheaper but requires you to empty it yourself (not fun)</li>
        <li><strong>Staying with family</strong> - If they're nearby and don't mind house guests</li>
        <li><strong>Phased renovation</strong> - Some contractors can keep your bathroom partially functional during the project</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For most people, renting a porta potty is still the simplest solution.
