      <p>
        One of the most common questions people ask before renting a porta potty: <strong>"Do I need a permit?"</strong> The answer, like most things involving local government, is: it depends on where you live and what you're using it for.
      </p>

      <p>
        The good news is that most residential and short-term rentals don't require permits. But there are situations where you'll need to check with your local authorities first. Let me break it down so you know exactly where you stand.
      </p>

      <AdSlot slot="content" />

      <h2 id="general-rule">The General Rule</h2>

      <p>
        Here's the quick answer for most situations:
      </p>

      <div class="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">Usually NO Permit Needed</h4>
        <ul class="text-green-700 space-y-1">
          <li>Private property for personal use (home renovation, backyard party)</li>
          <li>Short-term rentals (less than 30 days)</li>
          <li>Construction sites with active building permits</li>
          <li>Private events on your own property</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">Permit MAY Be Required</h4>
        <ul class="text-yellow-700 space-y-1">
          <li>Public property or right-of-way placement</li>
          <li>Long-term rentals (30+ days)</li>
          <li>Large public events</li>
          <li>Commercial use in some jurisdictions</li>
          <li>HOA-governed communities</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 id="by-situation">Permit Requirements by Situation</h2>

      <h3>Home Renovation</h3>
      <p>
        If you're renovating your bathroom and need a porta potty in your driveway for a few weeks, you typically <strong>don't need a permit</strong>. The unit is on your private property for temporary personal use.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, check with your HOA if you have one. Some homeowners associations have rules about temporary structures in driveways or visible from the street. They might require approval or limit how long the unit can stay.
      </p>

      <h3>Backyard Parties and Events</h3>
      <p>
        Hosting a graduation party, wedding reception, or family reunion on your own property? In most areas, <strong>no permit is required</strong>. It's your property, your guests, and a temporary situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exception: if your event is so large it affects traffic or neighbors significantly, some municipalities require event permits - and the restroom facilities might be included in that review.
      </p>

      <h3>Construction Sites</h3>
      <p>
        Construction sites typically don't need a separate permit for porta potties because they're covered under the building permit. OSHA requires adequate sanitation facilities, so the porta potty is considered part of the job site infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your general contractor usually handles this. Just make sure the unit placement doesn't block sidewalks or public access areas.
      </p>

      <h3>Public Events</h3>
      <p>
        Organizing a festival, fair, concert, or community event on public property? You'll almost certainly need permits - and those permits will include requirements for sanitation facilities. The permit process will specify:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimum number of units required</li>
        <li>ADA accessibility requirements</li>
        <li>Placement locations</li>
        <li>Servicing requirements during the event</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Street or Sidewalk Placement</h3>
      <p>
        If you need to place a porta potty on a public street, sidewalk, or right-of-way (common for urban construction), you'll need a permit. This is about public safety and accessibility - the city needs to know you're not blocking pedestrian traffic or creating hazards.
      </p>

      <h2 id="by-state">State-by-State Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        While permit requirements are usually set at the city or county level, here's what's typical in different regions:
      </p>

      <div class="overflow-x-auto my-8">
        <table class="min-w-full border border-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
          <thead class="bg-gray-50">
            <tr>
              <th class="px-6 py-3 text-left text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900">Region</th>
              <th class="px-6 py-3 text-left text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900">Typical Requirements</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody class="divide-y divide-gray-200">
            <tr>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-900">California, New York</td>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-600">Stricter rules in urban areas. LA and NYC often require permits for any street placement. Environmental regulations may apply near waterways.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-900">Texas, Florida</td>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-600">Generally relaxed for private property. Permits mainly for public events or long-term commercial use.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-900">Midwest States</td>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-600">Varies by municipality. Rural areas rarely require permits; cities may have specific ordinances.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-900">Northeast</td>
              <td class="px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-600">Older cities often have detailed regulations. Boston, Philadelphia, DC require permits for public placement.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2 id="how-to-check">How to Check Your Local Requirements</h2>

      <p>
        Here's the step-by-step process to find out if you need a permit:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Call your city or county building department</strong> - They can tell you about any permits or restrictions for temporary sanitation units.</li>
        <li><strong>Check with your HOA</strong> - If you live in a governed community, review your CC&Rs or call the management company.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask your rental company</strong> - Experienced local providers know the regulations in their service area. They deal with this daily.</li>
        <li><strong>For events, contact the permits office</strong> - If you're organizing a public event, the special events permit will cover sanitation requirements.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="hoa-rules">HOA and Neighborhood Rules</h2>

      <p>
        Even when no government permit is required, your HOA might have rules. Common HOA restrictions include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Time limits</strong> - "Temporary structures" may only be allowed for 14 or 30 days</li>
        <li><strong>Placement restrictions</strong> - Must be in driveway, not visible from street, or behind fence</li>
        <li><strong>Prior approval</strong> - You might need to submit a request to the architectural committee</li>
        <li><strong>Appearance standards</strong> - Some HOAs require neutral colors or screening</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Violating HOA rules can result in fines, so it's worth a quick email or call before your rental arrives.
      </p>

      <h2 id="rental-company">Your Rental Company Can Help</h2>

      <p>
        Most porta potty rental companies are familiar with local regulations. When you call for a quote, ask:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Do I need any permits for this rental?"</li>
        <li>"Are there any placement restrictions I should know about?"</li>
        <li>"Have you worked in my neighborhood before?"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        They'll often know the answers from experience. Some companies will even help you obtain permits if needed, though this may involve an additional fee.
      </p>

      <h2 id="consequences">What Happens If You Skip the Permit?</h2>

      <p>
        If a permit is required and you don't get one, potential consequences include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fines</strong> - Ranging from $50 to several hundred dollars depending on jurisdiction</li>
        <li><strong>Removal order</strong> - You may be required to remove the unit immediately</li>
        <li><strong>Event shutdown</strong> - For public events, code enforcement can shut things down</li>
        <li><strong>HOA penalties</strong> - Daily fines until the unit is removed or approved</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For a quick backyard party, realistically, enforcement is rare. But for larger events or commercial use, it's not worth the risk.
